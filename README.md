This repository contains a possible solution to the task for computer science classes of the 3rd November 2022.

Version 1.0 (initial commit) contains the following items:

- index.html: A simple navbar with a button to switch between light- and darkmode, as well as headings, paragraphs and unordered lists.
- /css/style.css: The styling for the html document. Responsible for e.g. centering the items in the div or changing the font family.
- /js/index.js: Contains the JavaScript-code to realize the theme-switcher button. Uses ternary operators for the least amount of lines of code possible.
